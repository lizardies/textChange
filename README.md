#textChange

Websocket example where all clients can see the changes made on a website
Tested on localhost port

Possible future extension towards a webpage where people can edit all content from as some form of a secret message board.
Definitely needs to be adjusted for that, but would be fun to find out how to adjust this to change imagery, audio files etc.
